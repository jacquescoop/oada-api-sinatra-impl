# OADA API Sinatra Implementation
A simple non-production implementation of the [OADA API specification](https://github.com/OADA/oada-api-spec) written in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). The concise nature of Sinatra and the ability to quickly create REST APIs was the motivation for choosing Sinatra for an implementation of the OADA API specification. This project is not meant to signify any particular language of preference by OADA but simply to be a sandbox to facilitate quickly iterating over potential design ideas for the API specification.
